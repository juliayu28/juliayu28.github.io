  				<h2>About Me</h2>
  				<p>Hi there! My name is Julia. I'm a second-year student at UC Berkeley. I'm pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Data Science, combining my love for problem solving and finding answers to some of the world's mysteries.</p> 
  				<p>I currently serve as a Teaching Assistant for <a href="https://cs88-website.github.io/">CS 88</a>, which teaches students programming in Python. I also work as the Curriculum Head for <a href="https://cs-kickstart.berkeley.edu/">CS Kickstart</a>, leading a team of 9 developers to create a curriculum on Python, web development, and design.</p>
  				<p>Apart from teaching and programming, I love to practice calligraphy and make crafts in my free time. Latest craft: <a href="miniaturehouse.jpg">this miniature house!</a></p></div>

        		<h3>Darkest Dungeon: A Minecraft Game</h3>
		        <p>Coded in Java, the adventure/puzzle game challenges players to find all the keys and unlock the magic door before their "insanity" runs out. If their character fails to collect enough light along the way, their insanity runs and out and they lose the game. The game supports: random world generation, so no two maps are the same, a dynamic GUI with hints depending on the player's location, and a "save checkpoint" so players can return to their games whenever.</p></p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R3UGQ3NR5ecD92Ax80vlXP2KcDECM5J1" class="btn btn-default" role="button">Demo Video</a>

        		<h3>Icebox</h3>
		        <p>Icebox is a grocery management app for iOS that aims to reduce food waste and help college students save time and work by streamlining the grocery process. For the project, I collected and analyzed market research data and designed the entire interface of the application. Studied Swift and XCode to also help with implementation.</p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FT8dCtDvJgIYgtXhsYrp2ZmPv_VvRvXesUi68ke5nBY/edit?usp=sharing" class="btn btn-default" role="button">Pitch Deck</a><a href="https://thespoon.tech/iceboxs-grocery-replenishment-service-wants-you-to-never-run-out-of-eggs/" class="btn btn-default" role="button">The Spoon Article</a></p>

		        <p>This project employs search algorithms such as A* to find the shortest path between two checkpoints on the map. It also supports search autocompletion, using a trie implementation. Coded in Java.</p>
